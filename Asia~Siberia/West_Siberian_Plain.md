## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The West Siberian Plain (Russian: Западно-Сибирская равнина, 
> romanized: Zapadno-Sibirskaya ravnina) 
> is a large plain that occupies the western portion of Siberia, 
> between the Ural Mountains in the west and the Yenisei River in the east, 
> and the Altai Mountains on the southeast. 
> 
> Much of the plain is poorly drained 
> and consists of some of the world's largest swamps and floodplains. 
> Important cities include Chelyabinsk, Novosibirsk, Omsk, and Tomsk, 
> as well as Surgut and Nizhnevartovsk.
>
> Winters on the West Siberian Plain are harsh and long. 
> The climate of most of the plain areas is either subarctic or continental. 
> 
> The plain had large petroleum and natural gas reserves. 
> **Most of Russia's oil and gas production** 
> was extracted from this area during the 1970s and 80s.
